# Overview of the Election Audit:

In this audit, we will be assisting a Colorado Board of Election employee - Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for US congressional district in Colorado. Our main task is to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidates, the percentage of votes for each candidate, the largest county turnout, the winner of the election based on popular votes, the winning vote count and the winning percentage.

Python automate these tasks and if the tasks are done successfully, the code written will be used to audit other congressional districts as well as senatorial districts and other local elections.

For this analysis, we use Python 3.7. Visual studio code is used because of its functions of allowing the work to be saved as well as its function for debugging and highlighting errors in our code.

The comma separated values data used are stored as election_results.csv while the output are stored in a text file named: election_results.txt.

# Election-Audit Summary:

The successful outcome of the script in deciding the total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes and the total number of votes as well as the percentage of votes and the winner of the election based on popular vote can be used in any election.

** Many elections will have more than 3 candidates, more than 3 counties as well as millions of votes. The successful modification of this script to incorporate this will make the script adaptable to any election.

** The script should also incorporate what will happen if the top 2 candidates in the election have the same vote counts and there is the need to have a re-run election.

These two modifications will make this script to be adaptable to any elections in any country.
